Hewlett-Packard MFP 'scan to' button daemon.

Polls a 'secret' website on the printer and starts a (scan) command when a button is pressed on the printer.

Compatible with HP LaserJet 3055, HP LaserJet Pro M127fn and probably other printers of that era.

The code is preserved mainly for historical reasons.
